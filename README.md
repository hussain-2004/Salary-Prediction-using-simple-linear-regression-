Prediction of salary based on years of experience using Simple Linear Regression

# Problem
In this project, we aim to build a salary prediction model to estimate the salary of a newly hired employee based on the salary data available with the HR department. The HR department has provided a dataset containing historical employee salary information, including features such as years of experience, and age. We will use this dataset to train a machine learning model that can predict the salary of a new employee based on their experience.


# Solution
The dataset for this project is provided in CSV format and contains the following features:

- `Years of Experience`: The number of years of experience the employee has in their field.
- `Age`: Age of the employee.
- `Salary`: The target variable, representing the salary of the employee.
  
By using this data, we can predict the salary of newly hired employees.

Upon verifying the correlation among different columns, The Salaries and YearsExperience has the strong connectivity!

Here, The Salary and YearsExperience fields has a strong correlation.

Clearly, The relationship is linear.

Therefore, By using simple linear regression we can train the model and predict the salaries using the Experience field.

So, we can predict the salary of the newly hired employee based on experience.


`The model has the metrics: `
